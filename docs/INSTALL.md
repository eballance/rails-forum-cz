# How Do I Install Discourse?

Simple 30 minute basic install:  
[**Beginner Docker install guide for Digital Ocean**][do]

Powerful, flexible, large install:  
[**Advanced Docker install guide**][docker]

The only officially supported installs of Discourse are the [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) based beginner and advanced installs. We regret that we cannot support any other methods of installation. (Alternately, you can try the [unofficial Heroku install guide][heroku], the [unofficial Ubuntu install guide][ubuntu], the [BitNami Discourse Virtual Machine package][bitnami] or [Cloud66][cloud66].)

### Hardware Requirements

- Dual core CPU recommended
- 1 GB RAM minimum (with [swap][swap]), 2 GB recommended

### Software Requirements

- [Postgres 9.1+](http://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Redis 2.6+](http://redis.io/download)
- [Ruby 1.9.3+](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (we recommend 2.0.0-p353 or higher)
